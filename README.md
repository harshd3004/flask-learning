# Flask Learning Project 💻

This repository documents my journey of learning Flask—Python's lightweight web framework.  
I'm exploring the core concepts by building small projects and logging daily progress.

## What I’ve Learned So Far

- Flask setup and routing
- Rendering HTML templates
- Template inheritance using base.html
- Static files: CSS & JavaScript (via `url_for()`)
- Handling POST requests and working with Flask forms
- Basic form validation and data retrieval using request.form


## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install requirements:
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
4. Run the app:
   python app.py
